		<h2>What your donations help accomplish:</h2>
		<p>1. In research conducted by the National Institutes of Health2, participants who chose to donate a portion of $100 they were provided enjoyed activated pleasure centers in the brain. Although this experiment was controlled and scientific, it did show that donating money simply makes you feel better, which is something we can all benefit from.</p>

		<p>2. Help Others in Need
        We don't live in a perfect world, and there's never going to be a perfect time to giveâ€”but there are always people out there in need of help. Whether interest rates are rising, the economy is in the doldrums, or even if you're experiencing financial difficulties of your own, the reality is that when you donate your money, you help others who need it.</p>
